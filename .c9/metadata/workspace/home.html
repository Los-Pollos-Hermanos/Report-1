especially with those related to the date, but tackled in Kyle's office hours. After that, I started working on boostrap for the design phase.</li>","         <li>Sergio: While creating the events-detail section, I encountered a lot of problems with the coding. This part that was assigned to me had a lot of programming, and  I was required to do some research as well as get some help to be able to finish it. After creating the events-detail section, I was assigned to do the redirection. This part was easier due to the fact that I only needed to link the event detail section to the user once the same user created a valid event.</li>","         <li>Miguel: In charge of event details, only possible with additional help!! \"Let the force be with you\"</li>","      </section>","      <p></p>","      <section><b>What's next:</b>","      <p></p>","      <ul style=\"list-style-type:square\">","        <li>Rodrigo: Start working on the design for some extra points, and in the first project change (donations).</li>","         <li>Sergio: On the next sprint I will focus on the layout of the webpage.
